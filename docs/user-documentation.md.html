  **OOP 4200 Durak**

## Card Skins

Durak provides the ability to customize the textures for the cards in the game.  
The skin packs are located in the `assets/textures/cardskins` folder within the
game directory. Each skin pack is a sub-folder within the aforementioned directory
that is named after the skin pack.

> For example, a set of card skins called `Big Numbers` will have a its folder
> named `Big_Numbers` (spaces are replaced by underscores) and have a directory
> structure as such:
>
> `<path-to-game-dir>/assets/textures/cardskins/Big_Numbers/<texture-files>`

The textures themselves are either PNGs or JPEGs. One texture exists for each
card plus an additional texture for the backside of all cards. The textures are
named as follows:

`<lower-case-suit>_<rank>.(png | jpg)`

For example:

+ `spade_ace.png`
+ `diamond_8.jpg`
+ `heart_king.jpg`
+ `club_6.png`

### Creating Custom Card Skins

Creating custom skin packs is simple. Simply copy one of the existing skin packs
renaming the folder to the name of your new skin pack. Then, open up the folder
and edit the textures within in your preferred image editor. When you launch
Durak you will be able to choose your newly created skin pack in the `options`
menu.
